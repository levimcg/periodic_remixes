## Periodic Remixes

This is a Processing sketch that visualizes the Periodic Table in a few different ways. Currently, there are four different branches that output different visualizations. I found most of the data on [this site](http://www.lenntech.com/periodic/periodic-chart.htm) already arranged in different configurationsâ€”pretty cool.

I don't have the final pieces posted anywhere official yet, but you can see some shots of them on [Dribbble](https://dribbble.com/levimcg).
